# Comparing dogs and cat ownerships in Taiwan

## Goal
1. Dog-cat ownership growth
Whether dog ownership correlates with number of stray dogs
Area chart of changes of pet ownership
(Map of regional changes of pet ownership)

## Findings
1. Cat popularity is on the rise but hasn't outnumbered household dogs
2. Keelung registered the most cats in 2023

## Data collection process
Data sources:
年度犬貓統計表- 農業開放資料平臺（Household pets）
動物收容統計表（Animal Adoption）
寵物登記地圖

## Data analysis process

## What I learned

## What I wished to improve 

Potential Roadblocks:
There was plenty of missing data when I looked at the stray dogs data. So even though I have cleaned the data needed (?) for the analysis, the missing data could l lose its value? 
But the dog-cat ownership data was sufficient, will just visualize this if the stray dog one doesn’t work out.
